# Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree: Project-1 Movie Trailer Website
 This project uses server-side code to create a static webpage that displays a list of movies. Each of these movie items can be clicked
 to  open their respective trailers. The application code demonstrates the use of python classes to create a reusable data structure
 with several different instances.
 
 ## Installation
 The project runs on 2.7.13 which can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/
 
 ## Dependencies
 The movie data in the project is sourced with the help of the IMDbPY, a python package that helps retrieve and store imdb information
 on movies, actors, tv series, etc. This package can be downloaded http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/ . The documentation for this package is
 available at the link http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/docs/README.package.txt.

 The application has the following three files :
 * entertainment_center.py
 * media.py
